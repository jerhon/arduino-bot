## Overview

This is a personal arduino project based on the LAFVIIN Multi-Functional Smart Car Kit.

### Danceoff

This is a class I wrote with my kids to program the robot to do certian dances.  After we were done, we had a danceoff where we had someone vote for their favorite dance.

## Tooling

Use the arduino IDE to load, or VS code after setting it up for c++/arduino development.
