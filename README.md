## Overview

This is a personal arduino project based on the LAFVIIN Multi-Functional Smart Car Kit.

### Danceoff

This is a class I wrote with my kids and wife to program the robot to do a dance they came up with.  After we were done, we had a danceoff where we had a 3rd party vote for their favorite dance.

dance3 was the winner.

## Tooling

Use the Arduino IDE to load, or Arduino extension for VS Code after setting it up for C++/Arduino development.
